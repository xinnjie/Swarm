import Foundation

// MARK: - PerformanceMetrics

/// Performance metrics snapshot for agent execution.
///
/// `PerformanceMetrics` captures timing information and parallel execution statistics
/// to measure performance improvements from concurrent tool execution.
///
/// This is an immutable snapshot created by ``PerformanceTracker/finish()``.
/// All properties are read-only and the type is `Sendable` for safe concurrent access.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - Captures total, LLM, and tool execution durations
/// - Tracks parallel execution usage
/// - Calculates speedup ratio when parallel execution was used
/// - Immutable and thread-safe
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let tracker = PerformanceTracker()
/// await tracker.start()
/// // ... execute agent operations ...
/// await tracker.recordLLMCall(duration: .milliseconds(500))
/// await tracker.recordToolExecution(duration: .milliseconds(100), wasParallel: true)
/// await tracker.recordToolExecution(duration: .milliseconds(150), wasParallel: true)
/// await tracker.recordSequentialEstimate(.milliseconds(250))
///
/// let metrics = await tracker.finish()
/// print("Total: \(metrics.totalDuration)")
/// print("LLM: \(metrics.llmDuration)")
/// print("Tools: \(metrics.toolDuration)")
///
/// if let speedup = metrics.parallelSpeedup {
///     print("Speedup: \(String(format: "%.2f", speedup))x faster with parallel execution")
/// }
/// ```
public struct PerformanceMetrics: Sendable, Equatable {

    /// including LLM calls, tool executions, and any overhead.
    public let totalDuration: Duration

    /// Time spent in LLM inference calls.
    ///
    /// Accumulated duration of all LLM API calls during execution.
    /// This helps identify whether performance is bound by inference time.
    public let llmDuration: Duration

    /// For parallel execution, this is the wall-clock time of the longest
    /// parallel batch, not the sum of individual tool durations.

    /// they were executed sequentially or in parallel.

    /// Use this to filter metrics when comparing parallel vs sequential.
    public let usedParallelExecution: Bool

    /// Estimated sequential duration for parallel tool batches.
    ///
    /// When parallel execution is used, this captures the estimated
    /// time if tools had been executed sequentially. Used to calculate
    /// the ``parallelSpeedup`` ratio.
    ///
    /// This value is `nil` when parallel execution was not used.
    public let estimatedSequentialDuration: Duration?

    ///
    /// Returns the ratio of estimated sequential time to actual parallel time.

    /// would have been.
    ///
    /// Returns `nil` if:
    /// - Parallel execution wasn't used
    /// - Estimated sequential duration is not available
    /// - Tool duration is zero
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// if let speedup = metrics.parallelSpeedup {
    ///     if speedup > 1.0 {
    ///         print("Parallel execution was \(speedup)x faster")
    ///     } else {
    ///         print("Parallel execution provided no speedup")
    ///     }

// MARK: - PerformanceTracker

/// Tracks performance metrics during agent execution.
///
/// `PerformanceTracker` is an actor that collects timing information during
/// agent execution. Call ``start()`` at the beginning, record events during
/// execution, and call ``finish()`` to create an immutable ``PerformanceMetrics``
/// snapshot.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// As an actor, `PerformanceTracker` provides thread-safe metric collection.
/// All methods are isolated to the actor and can be called from any context.
///
/// ## Usage Pattern
///
/// ```swift
/// let tracker = PerformanceTracker()
///
/// // Start tracking
/// await tracker.start()
///
/// // Record LLM call
/// let llmStart = ContinuousClock.now
/// let response = try await llm.generate(prompt)
/// await tracker.recordLLMCall(duration: ContinuousClock.now - llmStart)
///
/// // Record parallel tool execution
/// let toolStart = ContinuousClock.now
/// let results = try await executor.executeInParallel(tools)
/// let parallelDuration = ContinuousClock.now - toolStart
/// let sequentialEstimate = results.reduce(.zero) { $0 + $1.duration }
///
/// await tracker.recordToolExecution(duration: parallelDuration, wasParallel: true)
/// await tracker.recordSequentialEstimate(sequentialEstimate)
///
/// // Get final metrics
/// let metrics = await tracker.finish()
/// ```
///
/// ## Reuse
///
/// Call ``reset()`` to reuse the tracker for a new execution:
///
/// ```swift
/// await tracker.reset()
/// await tracker.start()
/// // ... track new execution ...
/// ```
package actor PerformanceTracker {
